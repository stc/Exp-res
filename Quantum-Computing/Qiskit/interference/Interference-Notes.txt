Interference Fields

- Chain of qubits: Each column corresponds to a qubit.
- Time evolution: Each row is a timestep.
- Marginal probabilities: P(qubit_i = |1>) gives the “intensity” for that qubit at that timestep.
- Interference: Small rotations and entangling gates create constructive/destructive interference patterns along the chain.
- Nearest-neighbor entanglement: CX gates propagate correlations along the chain.
- Rotations (RY): Introduce interference, creating constructive and destructive patterns.
- Space-time diagram: X-axis = qubit index, Y-axis = time, color = probability of |1>.
- Result: You see interference “waves” moving along the chain over time.

Why the current approach is consistent
- We start with an initial state (|000…0> → superposition).
- At each timestep:
  1.	We apply RY rotations to all qubits (local evolution).
	2.	We apply CX gates between neighbors (entanglement spread).
	3.	We do not reset the circuit — we keep building on the same qc.
	4.	We measure the statevector to compute marginal probabilities.

- This means the circuit we simulate at timestep t actually contains all gates up to t.
- Therefore, the probability distribution at timestep t depends on all previous timesteps — just like in a true unitary evolution.

So, the rows are consistent — they represent snapshots of the same evolving quantum state.


**** CONSIDERATIONS ****

In the current code, organic_mode changes how the qubits are rotated and entangled at each timestep to create less regular, more “organic” interference patterns.

Nearest Neighbour Entanglement:

Effect on patterns:
	•	Interference waves propagate locally along the chain.
	•	You see a smooth “light-cone” effect: correlations spread gradually from each qubit to neighbors.
	•	Patterns are more geometric and predictable, often symmetric along the chain.
	•	Use case: Good for seeing how correlations propagate along a linear qubit chain.

Alternating (Even) Entanglement:

Effect on patterns:
	•	Creates non-local correlations that skip qubits.
	•	Interference waves are more intricate; patterns appear less linear and more global.
	•	The Hadamard + CZ sequence introduces phase interference, generating more structured “fringe” patterns.
	•	Use case: Produces richer, more complex interference, good for artistic or organic-looking patterns.
