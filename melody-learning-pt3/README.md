# Melody Learning using RL & P5JS
This experiment is about to study different agents that are learning behaviours by getting rewards from their environments. It is based on A. Karpathy's ReinforceJS library, for full documentation and original demos visit [A. Karpathy's Webpage](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/reinforcejs).

This app will construct a nonconventional sonic experience, half way between being a visual music instrument and a radical game
